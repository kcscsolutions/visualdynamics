"""The octave-band parameters, as a table beside the spectrum.

One number is set here — bands per octave — and the conversion it
means is previewed over the narrowband data it will be made from: the
banded steps drawn on the same axes, so the trade (legibility against
resolution) is read on the spectrum being banded, not imagined.
Principle 13's four parts: the reading on the bar, these settings,
that preview, and the Apply button below.

Nothing here computes anything final. The button runs the same
`compute_octave` verb a script calls, with whatever spacing is set at
that moment.
