"""Truncating a record to the stretch that matters.

A recording rarely starts and stops where the test does: there is a
lead-in before the excitation reaches level, a tail after it stops,
sometimes a false start at the front of the file. The truncation names
the stretch to keep — a start and a stop, in seconds — and Truncate
Data makes the record that holds only that stretch, every channel cut
at the same two instants so the set stays one record.

**The clock is kept.** A truncated record's samples keep their
measured instants rather than being re-zeroed: the sample recorded at
t = 1.25 s still says 1.25 s, so events line up with the recording
they came from, with the setup log, and with any untruncated channel
set beside them. A re-zeroed clock would be a second time base to
reconcile, silently.

**No marks are carried.** `core.filters` carries the averaging frames
and shock windows onto what it makes because the abscissa is the same
and the marks still say what they said. Here the abscissa changed —
that is the whole point — and a frame or a window can refer to samples
that no longer exist, so the honest answer is a clean record: re-find
the shocks, re-frame the averaging, on the data that is actually
there.
