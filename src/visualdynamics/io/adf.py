"""I-DEAS Associated Data Files — .afu, .ati and .ash, read natively.

ADF is the binary sibling of the Universal File's dataset 58: the same
function types, the same data-type codes, the same interleaved-uneven
convention, in 512-byte blocks of little-endian float32. Shape files
add a file-wide node table and per-mode records. The formats originate
with SDRC I-DEAS and live on in Siemens NX. No public specification
exists, so this reader was **derived from paired sample files and
from published documentation — never from anyone's source code**.

Two facts a reader of the data should know, both established against
those samples: **ADF files store SI regardless of the writing
session's unit system** (round-tripped through all nine unit systems
the format admits, with and without the G's flag), so imports arrive
with units defined; and **the container stores float32 only** — data
written as double precision was narrowed by the writer, and no reader
can get it back.

The share with `unv.py` is deliberate: parsed function records become
the same entry dicts UNV's dataset-58 parser produces and are grouped
by `_build_data_objects` with SI factors, so an `.afu` and the
equivalent `.unv` import through one code path and cannot disagree.
