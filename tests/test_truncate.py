"""Truncating a record to the stretch that matters.

The core rules, pinned: the cut keeps the samples' measured instants
rather than re-zeroing the clock; both ends are inclusive; no marks
ride across, because they can refer to samples that no longer exist;
and the derived record's staleness follows the span the way a filtered
record's follows the filter.
