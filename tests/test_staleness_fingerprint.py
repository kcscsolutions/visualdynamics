"""A fingerprint records the settings, not the class that held them.

The staleness badge is only worth anything if it appears exactly when
the numbers would differ. It stopped being worth that the day a sixth
field (`pad`, the zero-padding experiment) was added to `Averaging`
(2026-08-27): the fingerprint was `astuple`, so the extra field
lengthened it, and every project saved before that opened with a
refresh badge on everything derived — over a story that said the same
thing twice, because nothing about the settings had moved.

So the fingerprint names its fields, and a field a recording predates
reads as the class's own default — and, symmetrically, a *stored* key
the class no longer has is ignored. (The `pad` field itself was
removed a day after it was added, once the mode fitter was shown not
to need it; the demonstration projects were regenerated rather than
carrying compatibility for a two-day window. The mechanism stays,
because the next settings field will come someday and this is what
makes adding or removing one survivable.)
