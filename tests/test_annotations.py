"""Every public attribute says what it is.

Explicit rather than implicit, which is the rule this project already
follows for links and project structure — and the reason the API
reference can say `node_id: IdArray` instead of `ndarray`, and an editor
can complete against it.

An annotation is a *claim*, and a claim is only worth what enforces it:
`core/validate.py` is the run-time half, and this is the one that stops
the claims from quietly going missing as the code grows. It walks the
package's own AST, so it needs nothing imported and costs milliseconds.

What counts as declared: an annotated assignment anywhere in the class
(`self.x: int = 1`, or a bare `self.x: int` before a branch), or a
class-level annotation. A name that is a **property** is declared by its
getter — `MainWindow.project_type` is a property over the Project, so
`self.project_type = ...` inside the class is a setter call and not a
declaration at all.
