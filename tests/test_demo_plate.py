"""The demonstration plate, held to its drawing and to the book.

Unlike the drone this is *not* marked slow: the plate exists to be
the fast article, and these run on every gate. The frequencies here
are the model's own frozen truth — the element itself is held to the
classical tables in `tests/test_fem.py`; what this file pins is that
the article stays the article.
