"""What a Linux bundle may not carry, and what it must.

The 0.0.1 AppImage started on the Debian release it was built on and died
on the next one, before drawing anything, because PyInstaller had
bundled `libstdc++` and mesa's driver resolved against that copy instead
of the host's. `packaging/system_libraries.py` carries the reasoning;
these tests hold the rule to the two things the day's measurements
actually established — that the C++ runtime goes, and that the X
libraries stay.
