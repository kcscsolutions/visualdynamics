"""Drawing a curve must not cost the size of the object it came from.

A 1356-record FRF took 43 seconds to plot one reference column and half a
second to plot eight cells. Neither number was about drawing: the conversion
to display units ran over every record in the object however few were asked
for, and re-derived the same scale factor from pint each time — 2713 round
trips to draw one curve. Both halves are guarded here.
