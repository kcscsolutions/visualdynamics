"""Photos out as the pictures they are.

The bytes are stored exactly as they arrived — that is why a `Photos`
object keeps them encoded rather than decoded — so writing them out is a
copy, and a JPEG that makes the trip loses no generation.

What a folder cannot hold is the *order*, which is the one thing this
export loses and the report cares about. Said here so it is a known
cost rather than a discovery.
